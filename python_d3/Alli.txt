Alli by Shel Silverstein

Alli loves me,
Alli cares,
Alli picks me peaches and pears.
Alli offers me candy and Cokes,
Alli listens and laughs at me jokes.
Alli helps when I get in a fight,
Alli does all my homework at night.
Alli misses me,
Alli cries,
Alli thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Alli is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Alli just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Alli's hand,
In the darkness where Alli usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Alli's gone!
